# Sustainable Foam-Core Chair - MMAE 232

---

## Project Overview
This project documents the design, analysis, fabrication, and testing of a lightweight, sustainable foam-core chair capable of supporting a 103 kg person **without using fasteners or adhesives**. The chair design emphasizes **lightweight construction**, **stress distribution**, and **environmentally friendly materials**.

---

## Features
- Supports a 103 kg load
- Constructed from foam-core board sheets (457 mm × 610 mm × 5 mm)
- Fastener-free assembly (interlocking design)
- Light-weighted design: 462 g
- Includes CAD modeling, FEA analysis, and laser-cut fabrication
- Demonstrates mechanical engineering design process, including concept generation, Pugh chart evaluation, lines of force analysis, and experimental testing

## Project Workflow
1. **Concept Generation:** Three sketches created and evaluated using a Pugh chart.
2. **Analysis:** Lines of force sketches and FEA used to identify stress concentration areas.
3. **Design Selection:** Chose Design 3 based on structural integrity, comfort, and ease of assembly.
4. **Fabrication:** Laser-cut foam-core parts and assembled without fasteners.
5. **Testing:** Incrementally tested the chair for weight tolerance, ending with a 103 kg load.
6. **Documentation:** Prepared technical report in IEEE LaTeX template.

## Learning Outcomes
- Application of mechanical engineering design principles to real-world problem.
- Experience with **lightweight structure design**.
- FEA and lines of force analysis for stress evaluation.
- Laser cutting and prototype assembly.
- Technical report writing using **LaTeX and IEEE format**.
